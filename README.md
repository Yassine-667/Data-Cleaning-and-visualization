# Data Mining Project

This repository contains code for a data mining project. There are two main algorithms:

1. Data Cleaning Script: This script reads in a CSV file of car data, cleans the data, and exports the changes to a new CSV file. The cleaning process includes removing duplicates, filling missing values, and converting data types. The cleaned data is then saved to a new CSV file.

2. Visualization Script: This script reads in the cleaned CSV file of car data, creates four visualizations, and saves them to a PNG file. The visualizations show the distribution of car prices, the relationship between car mileage and price, the relationship between car model year and price, and the relationship between highway fuel efficiency and maximum speed.

## Getting Started

To run these algorithms, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

## Running the Scripts 

1. Data Cleaning Script:

- Make sure that the CSV file path is correct in the script.
- Run the following command in your terminal: python data_cleaning_script.py
- The cleaned data will be saved to a new CSV file in the same directory.


2. Visualization Script:

- Make sure that the cleaned CSV file path is correct in the script.
- Run the following command in your terminal: python visualization_script.py
- Four PNG files will be created in the same directory, one for each visualization.
